## Iota-9
The Official Italian SCP Wiki Theme

This is the repository for the [Iota-9 theme](http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/component:theme), the new CSS used to style the Italian Branch of the [SCP Wiki](http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com).
Created and maintained by the Italian Branch's Tech Team and Administration/Moderation Staff.
Based on the '[Sigma 9](https://scpwiki.com/component:theme)' theme created for the SCP Foundation by Aelanna and edited for SCP Foundation by Dr Devan.

The codes are also derived from the [Simple Yonder](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:simple-yonder) theme by EstrellaYoshteEstrellaYoshte.
